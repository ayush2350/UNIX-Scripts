/* fudge = correction factor, routing, placement, etc. */
/* cap = fudge * cap per micron *
* I assume cap is in capacitance units per micron *

/* length_top = the length of one side of a square die (in our case, *
* a 4 TCU die of 2500u on a side of core area) length_10k = the *

* this is a core of a single TCU which is 900u on a side) */
